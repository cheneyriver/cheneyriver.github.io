## 2022.6-present

I am a research assistant in Professor [Wang Yang's](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/yang.wang) team at Xi'an Jiaotong University. In this role, I primarily analyze the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) dataset to explore the relationships between diversity, interdisciplinarity, and citation patterns. My work focuses on applying data science techniques and network science methodologies to uncover insights from large-scale academic data.
