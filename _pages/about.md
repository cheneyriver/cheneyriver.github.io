## Hi, there! ðŸ¥°


I am currently a senior student at Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, majoring in Mathematical Economics with a minor in Computer Science.   You can check my CV through this [link](https://cheneyriver.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

#### Research Interest: Compuatational Social Science

1) Information Dissemination and Misinformation, with emphasis on the role of algorithms, networks, and user behavior in the spread of information.

2) Science of Science, understanding how developments in science affect itself, as well as its impact on society.


#### Why Research?


When asked why I want to pursue research, my answer is simple yet profound: we live in an era saturated with information, often accompanied by conflict and complexity. In *"What is the Contemporary?"* by Giorgio Agamben, he suggests that "The contemporary is the one who firmly holds his gaze on his own time so as to perceive not its light, but rather its darkness." For me, research is my way of gazing into the complexities of our time through a scientific lens, seeking to understand the underlying forces that shape our world. It allows me to explore the unknown and contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities we face as a society.
