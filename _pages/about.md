## Hi, there! 🥰


I am currently a senior student at Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, majoring in Mathematical Economics with a minor in Computer Science.   You can check my CV through this [link](https://cheneyriver.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

## Research Interest: Compuatational Social Science


1) **Exploring Human Behavior in Digital Spaces:** I am particularly interested in understanding how people behave on social media platforms and other digital environments. My research focuses on analyzing patterns of interaction, engagement, and influence within these online communities. I seek to uncover how social dynamics shape user behavior and how technology impacts communication, decision-making, and societal norms.

2) **Information Dissemination and Misinformation:** I am also deeply interested in the processes by which information spreads in digital ecosystems. My research investigates the mechanisms of information dissemination, including the role of algorithms, networks, and user behavior in amplifying or curbing the flow of information. A key aspect of my work is identifying and addressing the challenges of misinformation and disinformation, examining how false narratives propagate and exploring strategies to mitigate their impact on public discourse.

## Why Research?


When asked why I want to pursue research, my answer is simple yet profound: we live in an era saturated with information, often accompanied by conflict and complexity. In *"What is the Contemporary?"* by Giorgio Agamben, he suggests that "The contemporary is the one who firmly holds his gaze on his own time so as to perceive not its light, but rather its darkness." For me, research is my way of gazing into the complexities of our time through a scientific lens, seeking to understand the underlying forces that shape our world. It allows me to explore the unknown and contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities we face as a society.
