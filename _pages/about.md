## Hi, there! ðŸ¥°


I am currently a senior student at Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, majoring in Mathematical Economics with a minor in Computer Science.   You can check my CV through this [link](https://cheneyriver.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My academic interests are deeply rooted in the exploration of **social big data**, with a particular focus on understanding and analyzing the wealth of information generated by social media and broader social systems. 

I am captivated by the opportunity to uncover patterns in human behavior that emerge from the intricate interplay of online interactions and societal dynamics. 

Furthermore, I am also intrigued by the transformative effects that **emerging technologies have on shaping human thought processes and behaviors**. The intersection of technology and society offers a rich landscape for investigating how innovations influence cognitive paradigms and social interactions, shaping the way we perceive, communicate, and engage with the world around us.

Right now, I am studying the front-end development, which is really interesting and helpful for my research.
