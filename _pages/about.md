## Hi, there! ðŸ¥°


I am currently a senior student at Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, majoring in Mathematical Economics with a minor in Computer Science.   

You can check my CV through this [link](https://cheneyriver.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

##### Research Interest: Compuatational Social Science & Human-AI Interaction

1. Information Seeking on Online Platforms and Better of Information Ecosystems
  In the digital age, online platforms have become the primary sources for people to search for various types of information. I am deeply interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of how individuals navigate through these platforms to find the information they need.
  On one hand, I focus on the cognitive and behavioral aspects of information search. How do users formulate search queries? How do they interpret and process the information they receive? I aim to understand these factors that can help users make informed decisions about their information needs.

  On the other hand, I am committed to improving the information ecosystem on these platforms. The current online environment is often plagued by issues such as information overload, misinformation, and echo chambers. I explore ways to design algorithms and interfaces that can filter out irrelevant and false information, and present users with more diverse and accurate content. 

2) Exploring New Modes of Human - Gen AI Interaction and Its Potential Applications in Daily Life

With the rapid development of General Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), such as large - language models, there is a great potential to reshape the way humans interact with technology. I am fascinated by the exploration of new interaction paradigms between humans and Gen AI. I am particularly interested in the potential of Gen AI to enhance human capabilities and improve the quality of life.
