## Hi, there! 🥰


I am currently a senior student at Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, majoring in Mathematical Economics with a minor in Computer Science.   

You can check my CV through this [link](https://cheneyriver.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

##### Research Interest: Compuatational Social Science & Human-AI Interaction

1) **Information Seeking on Online Platforms and Better of Information Ecosystems**
In the digital age, online platforms have become the primary sources for people to search for various types of information. I am deeply interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms of how individuals navigate through these platforms to find the information they need.

On one hand, I focus on the cognitive and behavioral aspects of information search. How do users formulate search queries? How do they interpret and process the information they receive? I aim to understand these factors that can help users make informed decisions about their information needs.On the other hand, I am committed to improving the information ecosystem on these platforms. The current online environment is often plagued by issues such as information overload, misinformation, and echo chambers. I explore ways to design algorithms and interfaces that can filter out irrelevant and false information, and present users with more diverse and accurate content. 

2) **Exploring New Modes of Human - Gen AI Interaction and Its Potential Applications in Daily Life**

With the rapid development of General Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), such as large - language models, there is a great potential to reshape the way humans interact with technology. I am fascinated by the exploration of new interaction paradigms between humans and Gen AI. I am particularly interested in the potential of Gen AI to enhance human capabilities and improve the quality of life.
