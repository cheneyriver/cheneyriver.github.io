Hi, there! ðŸ¥°


I am currently a third-year student at Xi'an Jiaotong University in China, majoring in Mathematical Economics with a minor in Computer Science.   You can view my CV through this [link](https://cheneyriver.github.io/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).

My academic interests are deeply rooted in the exploration of social big data. Specifically, I am fascinated by uncovering patterns in human behavior through the analysis and interpretation of various data types, including academic publication records and social media text data.

Additionally, I have a profound interest in the intersection of human interaction and technology. I am particularly curious about how modern advancements, such as big language models like ChatGPT, are reshaping our lives and thought processes. This includes their potential to enhance care in sectors like education and healthcare, where I believe AI can sometimes offer more precise support than traditional methods, particularly for vulnerable groups. My research also takes a sociological lens to examine the societal impacts behind algorithms and technology.

In my research endeavors, I employ a blend of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. On the quantitative side, my toolkit includes econometrics, bibliometrics, statistics, and various machine learning techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP)â€”skills honed through my undergraduate studies in economics. For qualitative insights, I rely on methods like semi-structured interviews and questionnaire design. My passion for social sciences drives my enthusiasm for qualitative research and analysis.
