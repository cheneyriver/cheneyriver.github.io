Hi,there! 🥰
I am a third-year student in China. My major is Mathmatical Economics and Finance(minor in computer science).
My research interest:

- Currently, I am very interested in social big data. Specifically, I like to clarify the patterns of human behavior through the discovery, mining and interpretation of data, such as the published data of papers, the text data of people on social media and other similar data.
- Beyond that, I have a huge passion for the interaction between people and technology. For example, how today's big language models, like ChatGPT, will change the way people live and think, and thus improve care in education or healthcare (I think that in many places, the care of vulnerable people is not as good as a qualified AI, which I hate to see, but it is true), And a sociological perspective to examine the people and society behind algorithms and technologies.

In my current research, I mainly use quantitative and qualitative analysis, among which quantitative methods include traditional metrology or statistical methods (my undergraduate training in economics has greatly cultivated my empirical analysis ability), as well as some common machine learning and deep learning methods (such as NLP). Qualitative analysis mainly involves semi-structured interview, questionnaire design, etc. My love for social science makes me full of enthusiasm for qualitative analysis.
