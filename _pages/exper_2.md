## 2023.3-present


I am a research assistant in Professor [Lu Zhicong's](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~zhiconlu/) team at the City University of Hong Kong. In Professor Lu's Digital Engagement and Empowerment Research Lab, I have contributed to two social computing projects using mixed-method approaches.

The first project explores how young women seek help on Chinese social media platforms, while the second focuses on how people search for legal information on social media. In both projects, my responsibilities included recruiting interviewees, conducting semi-structured interviews, and contributing to the writing of the research papers. I am excited to share that our second project is currently under submission for CHI 2025, and we are hopeful that our efforts will be rewarded.
